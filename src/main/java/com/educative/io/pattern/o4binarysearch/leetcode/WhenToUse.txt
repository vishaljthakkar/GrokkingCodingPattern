When can we use Binary search - Few hints when to consider using it? A general structure:
1. Sorted / Ordered
2. Minimum / Maximum
3. Maximum of minimums / Minimum of Maximums
4. Monotonicity is evident
5. Bound of the problem, expected complexity
6. If someone gives me an answer, can I check whether it is right or wrong? Basically can I simulate it?
7. If questions asks for some value up to certain accuracy (Say 6 point after decimal place), etc.
